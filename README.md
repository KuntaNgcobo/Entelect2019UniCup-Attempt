# Entelect2019UniCup-Attempt
This was my attempt at the Entelect 2019 University Cup, this was a 7 hour hackthon if I'm not mistaken.

Only the maps (.input files) and the pdf in this repo were provided at the beginning of the competition,all other relevant info about the hackthon itself is in the pdf.
